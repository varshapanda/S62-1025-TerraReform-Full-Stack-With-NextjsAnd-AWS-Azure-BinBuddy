# **BinBuddy** - Smart Waste Segregation & Management Platform

BinBuddy is a smart, AI-driven waste management web application that encourages community-led waste segregation.  
It provides real-time reporting, AI-based waste verification, and gamified incentives to promote sustainable waste practices.

---

### Problem Statement
Municipal waste management systems fail to track segregation at the source.  
BinBuddy bridges this gap by providing an easy-to-use digital interface for users to report, verify, and earn rewards for proper waste segregation.

### Solution
A gamified web platform that:
- Allows users to upload images of waste for AI verification (Gemini API)
- Awards points for verified waste reports.
- Displays community leaderboards and badges
- Enables authorities to track reports and manage collection

## Reflection

This structure was chosen to ensure:
- **Modularity:** Each feature is isolated, easier to manage.
- **Scalability:** New components and pages can be added without breaking existing ones.
- **Collaboration:** Multiple developers can work in parallel safely.
- **Clarity:** Maintains consistency and simplicity in navigation and code readability.

This foundation sets the tone for all upcoming sprints — including API integration, database connection, and deployment.

## 🧩 Code Quality Configuration

### 🔹 Why Strict TypeScript Mode Reduces Runtime Bugs
Enabling strict mode in TypeScript enforces strong type checking, catches potential errors during development, and prevents undefined or invalid type issues at runtime.

---

### 🔹 What ESLint + Prettier Rules Enforce
- **ESLint:** Detects syntax errors, unused variables, and enforces clean coding practices.  
- **Prettier:** Formats code consistently (semicolons, quotes, spacing).  
Together, they maintain a uniform and readable code style.

---

### 🔹 How Pre-Commit Hooks Improve Team Consistency
Pre-commit hooks (via Husky + lint-staged) automatically lint and format staged files before commits, ensuring every commit follows project standards and preventing unformatted or buggy code from being pushed.
